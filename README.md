## What is GitHub Authentication?

GitHub authentication is a process that verifies the identity of users accessing GitHub services. It ensures secure interactions by confirming user credentials, such as usernames and passwords, or using more advanced authentication methods like SSH keys or OAuth tokens. Authentication safeguards user accounts and allows for authorized access to repositories and collaborative features on GitHub.

| GitHub Authentication Methods | |
| -------------------- | --------------------|
| Username and Password | The traditional method where users provide their username and password to access their GitHub account. |
| Personal Access Tokens (PATs) | PATs are alternative credentials that can be used instead of passwords. They offer scoped access to specific GitHub resources and can be generated and managed within a user's GitHub account settings. | 
| SSH Keys | Secure Shell (SSH) keys provide a secure and convenient way to authenticate with GitHub. Users can generate an SSH key pair and associate the public key with their GitHub account. |
| OAuth | GitHub supports OAuth authentication, allowing users to authenticate using third-party applications or services that integrate with GitHub. This method enables single sign-on (SSO) and enhances security by not sharing the user's actual GitHub credentials with the third-party application.
| GitHub Apps | GitHub Apps are another method of authentication that allows third-party applications to access GitHub on behalf of a user or organization. They offer granular permissions and can be installed on specific repositories or organizations.

These authentication methods provide users with flexibility and security options based on their specific needs and preferences when interacting with GitHub services.
